## Spacebook - Exported Projects
Welcome! Seems like you are interested in the exported code from the Supernova Studio. You've definitely arrived on the right place. We haven't modified it in any way, folders are uploaded exactly how Supernova produced them.

If you want to check the iOS Project, please navigate to the */iOS* directory (requires XCode 9+).

If you want to check the Android Project, please navigate to the */Android* directory (requires Android Studio 3.0+).

If you want to check the React Native Project, please navigate to the */React Native* directory (requires brew installed and then an editor of your choice - Atom, VS Code etc.).

Finally, the most convenient way how to download all the data at once (which we recommend) is to click "clone or download" at the top -> Download Zip. This will download you all platforms at once.

## About Supernova Studio

Supernova Studio is the first tool which truly bridges the gap between designers and developers. It does this by converting your design files to native components and the code. If you want to learn more, visit [Supernova Studio](https://supernova.studio/).
